# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eliasto! 
I am a student school at **The Leonard de Vinci Engineering School** located in **La DÃ©fense, Paris**.
Iâ€™m interested in technologies like *Flutter* and *React*. 

I'm currently working as a software engineer in an apprenticeship at SNCF Connect & Tech, building and maintaining SNCF Connect, the national railway company app in France.
